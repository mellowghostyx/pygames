    """Launches PyGames in the command-line.

    Runs the PyGames application in the command-line, using command-line
    arguments `argv` as the arguments for the `Application.run()` method, and
    responding to any BadArgumentErrors with a brief error message and an
    early exit. This is intended for bundling the application with Poetry,
    which prefers (but does not necessarily require) executable packages to
    organize the executable section of their code into a single function.

    Note:
        This is mainly intended for running the application *as* an
        application, particularly one installed via pipx.

    # NOTE: There's no point in unit-testing this function: it merely
    # initializes an Application object and calls the `run()` method on it with
    # some simple exception handling. The only testable aspect of this code is
    # the `run()` method, which can be tested on its own.

    # sys is only needed if this method is called (i.e. if package is used
    # as an executable), otherwise it should not be included in the package
