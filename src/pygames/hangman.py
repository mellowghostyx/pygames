"""A command-line implementation of the game 'Hangman'.

A version of the game 'Hangman' made for the command-line interface, wrapped
into a single class. The game can be played through the `Hangman` class
contained in this module, like so: ::

    game = Hangman()
    game.launch()

Alternatively, you can play the game by executing this file, i.e. by
running `python hangman.py`. If you are on a Unix-based system, you can
also convert this file into an executable via `chmod +x hangman.py`, then
run the file directly.
